Introduction
============

![SMD Challenge](images/project.png) 
Test your surface mount soldering skills out, starting with a 1206 package and work your way down into an oblivion of frustration. Powered by a CR2032 coin cell and Attiny 85 SOIC. Be warned that trying to hand solder a 0201 package, which is just slightly larger than a grain of sand, may be considered evidence of insanity and get you committed to bad places by your loved ones and/or arch nemesis.I have submitted to request from miserable people to make this an unfortunate kit. Don't think I'm doing you any favors: https://www.tindie.com/products/MakersBox/smd-challenge/
