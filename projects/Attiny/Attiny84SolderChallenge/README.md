Introduction
============

![Soldering Challenge](images/project.png) 
Test your soldering skills, starting with standard through-hole components and work your way down into smaller and smaller surface mount components.  If you only get the through-hole components to light, you will still be greeted with a surprise if you spin the board on a pencil!

Design Files
============
This project is designed using Open Source [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/). Design files are located in the [design_files](design_files/) folder.  You can oogle the [schematic](images/project.sch.png).


Firmware
========
This project is programed using the Open Source [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/). I use my Open Source [AVR Programming Shield](https://www.tindie.com/products/MakersBox/yet-another-programming-shield/) to program the Attiny. The firmware is located in the [firmware](firmware/) folder.
