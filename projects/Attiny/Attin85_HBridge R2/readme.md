Firmware
========
This project is programed using the Open Source [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/). I use my Open Source [AVR Programming Shield](https://www.tindie.com/products/MakersBox/yet-another-programming-shield/) to program the Attiny. The firmware is located in the [firmware](firmware/) folder.
