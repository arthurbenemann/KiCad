A quick and easy "I Can Solder!" badge project.

Bill Of Materials
=================
  
- 1 ea. Perfect purple PCB, [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/SdA1N3BS)  
- 1 ea. SMD Battery holder, [Linx BAT-HLD-001](https://www.digikey.com/short/jz1cf5)
- 1 ea. 5 mm RGB Color changing LED, [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/short/jzvzvb) or [Amazon](http://a.co/841utUf) 
- 2 ea. 100 ohm 1/8W Resistor, [Stackpole CF18JT100R](https://www.digikey.com/short/qq8mtn)
- 1 ea. CR2032 Battery, [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/short/jzvzdq) or [Amazon](http://a.co/3KOiZ4U)
- 1 ea. (Optional) 10mm Tie-tack pins with clutch back [Ebay](http://r.ebay.com/CVhwgo) 

Design Files
============
This project is designed using Open Source [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/). Design files are located in the [design_files](design_files/) folder.  You can oogle the [schematic](docs/project.pdf).

Firmware
========
None.  The flashing LED handles all of the magic.

Assembly Instructions
=====================

- If you are a beginner, check out [SparkFun's Tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering) and/or [Carrie Ann's video](https://youtu.be/P5L4Gl6Q4Xo).
- Start with the resistors as they have no polarity and are heat tolerant while you are getting a feel for it.
- The LED has a polarity and the long leg is the anode (positive) and goes in the hole marked "+".
- The battery holder is actual a surface mount part.  
  - Heat the gold pads and melt a little solder on to each side. 
  - Make sure the opening of the battery holder faces downward so you can get the battery in and out.
  - Heat the holders leg on top of the blobs till they melt down into it. 
  - Reheat to adjust alignment, and add more solder if necessary.
- The optional tie-tack is attached the same as the battery holder, although you may want something like tweezers to hold it as it gets hot fast.
